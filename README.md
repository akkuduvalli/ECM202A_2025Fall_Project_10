# ecem202a_project

This is recommended repository template for UCLA ECEM202A / CSM213A projects.

Use the folders as follows:

* doc/ for GitHub Pages website content
* software/ for code used in your project
* data/ for data data used in your project

You may add additional files and folders as necessary.

The doc/ folder has a simple GitHub Pages site structure using markdown, but you can put any static html content there. GitHub Pages looks for index.html as the root file for the website and if that is not found then index.md, and then README.md. Jekyll (the static site generator used by GitHub Pages) will convert markdown content into html. Please update docs/\_config.yml with your project's title and description.
