3. Technical Approach

Describe your full system / methodology. Use visuals liberally.

Recommended subsections:

• System Architecture

Include a block diagram or pipeline figure.

• Data Pipeline

Explain how data is collected, processed, and used.

• Algorithm / Model

Use math, pseudocode, or diagrams as needed.

4. Evaluation & Results

Include clear, well-labeled figures. Consider:
	•	Accuracy, latency, energy plots
	•	Comparative tables
	•	Visualizations (spectrograms, heatmaps, bounding boxes)
	•	Ablation results
	•	Failure-case analysis

Each figure should have a caption and a short interpretation.
